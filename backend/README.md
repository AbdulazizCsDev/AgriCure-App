# AgriCure — Backend (FastAPI + ML pipeline + Web UI)

Backend service for **AgriCure**. Serves the hierarchical **ResNet50** plant-disease
pipeline (Stage 1 plant → Stage 2 disease) behind a REST API, with a CLIP plant-gate,
confidence-based abstention to a human-review queue, Supabase `pgvector` similarity
search, and LLM-generated care advice.

> This is the backend reference. For the project overview, architecture diagram, and
> repo layout, see the [root README](../README.md).

> **Note:** the running app's internal name/version is still `AgroCure v4` (FastAPI
> `title`, `config_v4.py`). Only branding/docs were renamed to AgriCure — the code
> module names were left untouched to avoid breaking the trained pipeline.

## Run (full mode — models loaded locally)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows  (use: source .venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env            # optional: enables Supabase / LLM features
uvicorn main:app --port 8000
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** — drag in a leaf photo and get the diagnosis.

> The model weights (`models/*.pth`) are tracked with **Git LFS** (~630 MB). Run
> `git lfs install` before cloning so they download automatically.
> First request after startup loads 7 models into memory — give it a few seconds.
> Runs on GPU automatically if available, otherwise CPU.

### Example

```bash
curl -F "file=@leaf.jpg" http://localhost:8000/predict
```
```json
{
  "plant": "Tomato", "disease": "Blight",
  "label": "Tomato | Blight",
  "confidence": 0.93, "stage1_conf": 0.99, "stage2_conf": 0.94,
  "latency_ms": 41.2
}
```

## Configuration (`.env`)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Every feature degrades safely if its keys are missing —
the API still runs (similarity, review, advice simply become no-ops).

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | for review + similarity | Supabase project (server-side key only) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | optional | LLM care advice & chat (omitted if unset) |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | optional | defaults to `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `REVIEWER_PIN` | recommended | reviewer dashboard access code (default `314159`) |
| `MODEL_API_URL` | optional | enables light **proxy** mode (see below) |

## Non-plant rejection (plant gate)

Before diagnosing, every image passes through `plant_gate.py`. All checks share **one**
CLIP image embedding (encode once, reuse):

1. **CLIP zero-shot gate** — CLIP (open_clip, ViT-B-32) scores the image against
   "plant leaf" prompts vs "animal / person / hand / car / object / screenshot"
   prompts. It only passes if the plant group wins (`PLANT_THRESHOLD`). This is a
   direct *"is this a leaf?"* signal, so it accepts hard/ambiguous real leaves and
   rejects cats, hands, cars, faces — things a confidence threshold cannot separate.
2. **Confidence floor** — a last-resort net; rejects only if the plant classifier
   is below `STAGE1_MIN_CONF` (kept very low so real leaves are never rejected here).

### Healthy check
If the image is a plant, CLIP scores it against "healthy leaf" vs "sick leaf / leaf
with spots" prompts. If the healthy group wins `HEALTH_THRESHOLD` (0.70, set high on
purpose), the API returns `healthy: true` and skips disease diagnosis.

> ⚠️ CLIP is **weak** at healthy-vs-diseased (a fine, spot-level distinction). The
> threshold is biased so a *sick* leaf is rarely called healthy, at the cost of
> sometimes calling a healthy leaf "diseased". For reliable health detection, train a
> dedicated healthy/diseased classifier.

### Framing tip
CLIP also flags **wide / whole-plant shots** (vs a close-up single leaf) and adds a
non-blocking `framing_tip` to the response, steering users toward the close-up
single-leaf photos the model was trained on. Tune with `FRAMING_THRESHOLD` (0.50).

### Open-set + similarity (trust over guessing)
Stage-1 signals (confidence, top-1/top-2 margin) plus a CLIP "known-species" check
flag scans that may **not** be one of the 16 supported species — these are returned as
a best guess *and* queued for expert review. A confident `pgvector` similarity match
(`match_labeled_images`) that disagrees with the CNN is treated as evidence the CNN is
wrong. Below the confidence floor, AgriCure **abstains** and routes the scan to the
reviewer dashboard rather than showing a confident wrong answer.

Tune strictness at the top of `plant_gate.py` (`PLANT_THRESHOLD`, `STAGE1_MIN_CONF`,
`HEALTH_THRESHOLD`, `FRAMING_THRESHOLD`, plus the prompt lists).

> The CLIP weights (~350 MB) download once on first startup and are cached.

## Deployment modes

- **Full** (default) — `torch` + CLIP load locally; all features available. Used in dev
  and on a GPU host.
- **Proxy / light** — set `MODEL_API_URL` to a separate model service (e.g. a Hugging
  Face Space). The web app then forwards `/predict` to that service and skips loading
  `torch`/CLIP, so it runs on a tiny instance. This is what the `Dockerfile` builds
  (using `requirements-app.txt`, which has no `torch`).

## Supabase setup

The review queue, similarity library, taxonomy, and cached advice live in Supabase.
Apply the SQL in `supabase/migrations/` (in order) to a fresh project, then set
`SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` in `.env`. See
[`supabase/README.md`](supabase/README.md) and [`SHARE_DATABASE_GUIDE.md`](SHARE_DATABASE_GUIDE.md)
for the schema, the `pgvector` similarity function, and how to seed the library.
